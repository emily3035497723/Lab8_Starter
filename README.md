### Graceful Degradation
Graceful degradation is a web design strategy that ensures a website still works even if some advanced features—like JavaScript or Service Workers—aren’t supported or fail to load. Service Workers run in the background and help enable features like offline browsing, caching of files, and background data sync, which improve performance and user experience. But even if Service Workers aren’t supported, the core HTML content still loads and the site remains usable. This means graceful degradation ensures that essential content and functionality are always available, regardless of browser capability.
