### Graceful Degradation
Graceful degradation is a web design strategy that makes sure a website still works even if some advanced features—like JavaScript or Service Workers—aren’t supported or fail to load for some reason. Service Workers add extra features like offline access and caching to improve user experience. But even if the browser doesn’t support Service Workers, the basic HTML content still shows up. In general, graceful degradation means that to make sure the core content stays usable no matter what.
